# 62WR_PistiBot
>Play pisti against a 62wr bot or collect data with 2 bots against each other.

>Currently collected data(217000+datas) is collected by datacollectorpy.

>Bot has a simple working principle:

Bot can see both its and players cards, and if a card has a potential of pisti, bot keeps it until the last second.
If bot can make pisti or get the cards on the table, immediately does this.
Bot has no priority for playing with JACK cards.
